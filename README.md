System76 power indicator
===============

This indicator is meant to be a tray icon switcher for all the other desktops 
besides the Gnome desktop which is already supported by the fabolous system76 guys.

Prerequisites
============
Since this is a system76 powr indicator you need to either use a pop! os or installed system76-power by yourself, somehow â€¦
Besides that we need python and a bit of gtk support.

- System76-power you have to install by yourself

The tool itself needs a firm:

```shell
sudo apt install python3
```

Installation
============
```shell
sudo bash ./setup.sh
```
